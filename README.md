# Predict credit card default

## The competition: Financial Services at IE's MBD

We get 2 csv's with with real (yet transformed for privacy) data from a bank.

The training set will contain the **target** binary variable, which will be a 1 if the customer's monthly credit card fee has been unpaid and 0 otherwise. That is the variable that the test dataset is missing and we will be trying to predict in this notebook.

## To be able to run the Notebook smoothly, run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pauroger/predict_credit_card_default

cd predict_credit_card_default

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
